This is how to set the language for an individual post or page non-regarding of the default language set on WP

It’s particularly important when we have a multilanguage website so that the html code displays the right language.

Install plugin "advanced custom fields" by "Delicious Brains"

Create a new Field Group

* Add field "pagelang" (Label it as you want, but the field name should match the one in the code below)

  * Field type = select
  * Choices (enter the language codes - 1 per line) ([Here are the codes](http://quivi.sourceforge.net/languagecodes.html))
  * Enter default value code
* Select Location (Where you want the custom field to appear)

Add the following lines of code to functions.php

```
add_filter('language_attributes', 'language_attributes_fix');
function language_attributes_fix( $language_attributes ) {
global $post;
if(!empty($post->pagelang)){
return str_replace('en-GB', get_post_meta($post->ID, 'pagelang', true) ,$language_attributes);}
return $language_attributes;
}
```

Replace "en-GB" with the default language of your website

Now when creating a page or post, you have to select a language that will be set as the page/post language.

Note: As you might already have many posts and pages created, it could take a lot of time to edit the language of each page individually. Fortunately, there is a free plugin that allows adding custom fields created with the plugin “advanced custom fields” to the quick and bulk edit of WP. This plugin is called “ACF QuickEdit Fields” by Jörn Lund.

Install it, then go back to the custom field you created and toggl the new options “Quick Edit” and “Bulk Edit”
